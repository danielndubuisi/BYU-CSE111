CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program? Finance Tracker

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve? It can be difficult to keep track of cash flow for a person or a business. This program keeps a log of expenses and income and helps our user track their finances.

3. What will you learn from developing this program? A few things I will learn from this project are:
    - I will learn to develop and test my own functional program by applying all the skills and knowledge I have acquired in this course.
    - I will practice writing and testing functions.
    - I will learn error handling for my program to ensure it runs smoothly.
    - I will learn to plot graph for visual representation of data.

4. What Python modules will your program use? Some modules I will use include: 
    - csv 
    - pandas 
    - matplotlib
    - datetime
    - pytest

    (Some examples are: csv, datetime, functools, matplotlib, math,
    pandas, pytest, random, requests, and tkinter.)

5. List the names of functions you will need? The functions I will need are: 
    - initialize_csv
    - add_entry
    - get_date
    - get_amount
    - get_category
    - get_description
    - get_transactions
    - get_total_income
    - get_total_expense
    - plot_transactions

    (Remember that the most reusable functions don't get user input and
    don't print results but instead have parameters and return a result.
    Functions that get user input and print results are important and do
    useful work but are not easily reusable.)

    (Remember also that it's hard to test functions that get user input
    and print results. It's easy to test functions that don't get user
    input and don't print results but instead have parameters and return
    a result. Therefore, you should write most of your program functions
    to have parameters and return a result.)

6. List the names of the test functions you will write. ? Test Fuctions include: 
    - test_get_date
    - test_get_amount
    - test_get_category
    - test_get_total_income():
    - test_get_total_expense():
    - test_get_transactions
